## hashy.js ##

Smooth scroll to internal anchors when clicking "hash" links (e.g. href="#foobar").

Offset scroll amount by the height of a given element including on page load.

    <script src="hashy.js"></script>
    <script>
        hashy('.smooth-scrolling-links', #fixed-header');
    </script>

Marvelous.

Relies on jQuery because I haven't made it not. Pull requests are accepted.
